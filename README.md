# What's up man?

So I thought to myself, before really doing a lot of stuff I should take some time and update my profile and really talk about me, because my profile Readme was generated by AI XD

also
I haven't been as active as I would like to be, but I'm trying to change that XD



## About me:

- 🖥️ I love game and software dev
- 🧠 Checking out and creating (harmless) malware is probably whatI enjoy the most :)
- 🔐 Tried some hacking stuff but I'd rather stick to the GDI Malware stuff
- :heart: Favorite language is definetly C++

I actually hate using libraries and 3rd party libraries and stuff for everything because of the fear it will someday just not be updated anymore or having to watch out for some licensing stuff.
I just wanna code and maybe make a few bucks with Games and all..
At some point in my "career" I realised a lot of the time you have to use Libraries and APIs, because if you don't, you will just end up creating your own Operating System.
But that still doesn't change I am trying to do as much from scratch as I can XD. The worst part about 3rd party libraries is the installation/setup tho.. 
I am way too stupid for that lol.

  <summary>Info about AI</summary>
  I am often using AI because it *Helps*, I use it as a tool and not as a solution. Also often there are just no good tutorials on YouTube, good documentations or anything else. So I use ChatGPT's "Search" feature to get solutions on things I have no Idea how to implement.
This, again does not mean I am a vibe coder or have no real skills. I am still actively coding by myself and only rarely using ChatGPT for the hardest things.


I also use AI for my README's to just get them quickly done. When completely finishing a project though (without issues) and when I have enough time, I update them myself but I still "design" them with MD (markdown) features and Emojis to make them "more enjoyable" to read.

Also thank you for checking out my Account :)
