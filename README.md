  <summary>Info about AI</summary>
  I am often using AI because it *Helps*, I use it as a tool and not as a solution. Also often there are just no good tutorials on YouTube, good documentations or anything else. So I use ChatGPT's "Search" feature to get solutions on things I have no Idea how to implement.
This, again does not mean I am a vibe coder or have no real skills. I am still actively coding by myself and only rarely using ChatGPT for the hardest things.


I also use AI for my README's to just get them quickly done. When completely finishing a project though (without issues) and when I have enough time, I update them myself but I still "design" them with MD (markdown) features and Emojis to make them "more enjoyable" to read.

Also thank you for checking out my Account :)
